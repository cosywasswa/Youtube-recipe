         <h3>Scientists Discovered a Giant Asteroid That Might Hit Earth!</h3>
         <p>65k views 1 day ago</p>
         <p>Somewhere out there in the solar system, orbiting the Sun every 271 days, is an asteroid called 2023 DW that was recently spotted 
            when it came within just 9 million kilometers [5.6 million miles] of Earth. It is a 50 meter [165 feet] diameter rock.
             About the same size of rock that caused the Tunguska Event.

            NASA said 2023 DW had a â€œ1 in 560 odds'' of hitting the Earth in 2046, 
            giving us a pretty good chance the rock will miss the Earth entirely. </p>
